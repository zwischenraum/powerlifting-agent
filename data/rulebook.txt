 GENERAL  RULES  OF POWERLIFTING  
 
Throughout this rule book, for reasons of brevity, wherever the words “he” or “his” occur, such reference is deemed  
apply  to either  sex. All references  to gender  should  be revised  to secure  equal  rights  for both genders,  and not mentioned  
women  as something  that need  separate  rules,  like in the below  example  from  the Weighing  In. In competitions  in which  
both sexes are competing  
 
(a) The International  Powerlifting  Federation  recognizes  the following  lifts which  must  be taken  in the same  
sequence  in all competitions  conducted  under  IPF rules:  
 
A. Squat  B. Bench  Press  C. Deadlift  D. Total  
 
(b) Competition takes place between lifters in categories defined by sex, body weight and age. The Men’s and  
Women’s  Open Championships  permit  lifters  from  1 January  in the calendar  year he/she  reaches  19 years  and 
upwards.  
(c) In the event of a Powerlifting or Bench Press Championships being combined e.g.  with a Sub -Junior, Junior  
Open & Master's Championships having both Classic (1 category) and Equipped (1 category), a lifter has the  
option  of competing  in both Championships.  The athlete  shall  be required  pay entry  fee for both championships  
and will be required to compete twice. No lifter is allowed to compete 2 times in Classic or 2 times in  
Equipped . Master 3 & 4 is not allowed to compete in Open Class. Once the athlete is entered on the  
Preliminary Nomination, he/she may not change their age division. The lifter may only change the weight class  
on the Final Nomination.  
(d) The rules  apply  to all  levels  of competition.  
(e) Each competitor is allowed three attempts on each lift. The lifter’s best valid attempt on each lift counts toward  
his competition  total.  If two or more  lifters  achieve  the same  total,  the lighter  lifter ranks  above  the heavier  lifter.  
(f) If two lifters  register  the same  bodyweight  at the weigh in  and eventually  achieve  the same  total at the end of 
the competition,  the lifter  making  the total first will take precedence  over the other  lifter. Where awards  are 
presented  for best squat,  bench  press  and deadlift  or if a world  record  is broken,  the same  procedure  will apply.  
2. The IPF, through  its member  federations,  conducts  and sanctions  the following  World  Championships:  
The major events  on the IPF  calendar  are as  follows:  
• Equipped  World  Open  Powerlifting  Championship  
• Equipped  World  Sub-Junior  and Junior  Powerlifting  Championship

• Classic  Word  Bench  Press  Championship  (Open,  Sub-Junior/Junior  and Master)  
• University  World  Cup 
• Other  international  events  as approved by  the EC. 
 
The Championship Secretary, in consult with the Executive Committee, shall ensure that major international  
events do not clash. If necessary, sanction(s) may be refused to achieve an orderly Calendar. If necessary, the  
events  on the Calendar may  be combined into  one championship.

item 11. 
If a member  of a team  is found  to have  committed  a violation  of the IPF  Anti-Doping  Rules  during  an Event  where  
a team ranking is based on the addition of individual results (points), the points of the Athlete committing the  
violation will be subtracted from the team result and may not be repeated by the resulting points of another team  
member.  
 
10. Any nation  having  been  a member  of the IPF  for more  than three  years  should  include at least  one international  referee

Team  and 5 Bronze  to the 3rd Best Team.  In the case of a tie for the  classification  of a team  or a nation,  the team  having  
the largest  number  of first places  will be ranked  first. In the case of a tie between  two nations  having  the same  number  
of first places, the one having the most second places will be classified first, and so on through the placing of the  
maximum  of five scoring  lifters.  Should  teams  or Nations  finish  equally  after this procedure  has been  applied,  
then the team  or Nation  with the greater  total number  of IPF points  will be declared  the higher  placed.  Teams  with  less 
than  3 lifters  will not receive  medals.  
 
12. At all IPF Championships a “Best lifter” award shall be given to the lifter who produces the best performance based  
upon the IPF formula. Awards will also be presented to second and third places. Categories with less than 3 Lifters  
will not receive any “Best Lifter”  awards.

upon totals.  In addition, medals or merit award certificates shall be presented for first, second and third places in the

Should  a lifter  fail to succeed  in either  or both of the squat  or bench  press  disciplines  he/she  may continue  to 
compete  for the remainder  of the contest,  and the lifter  will be eligible  for awards  in any discipline  in which  he/she

POWERLIFTS  AND  RULES  OF PERFORMANCE  
 
Squat  
1. The lifter shall face the front of the platform. The bar shall be held horizontally across the shoulders, hands and  
fingers  gripping  the bar. The hands  may be positioned  anywhere  on the bar inside  and or in contact  with the inner  
collars.  
2. After removing the bar from the racks, (the lifter may be aided in removal of the bar from the racks by the  
spotter  / loaders)  the lifter  must  move  backwards  to establish  the starting  position.  When the  lifter  is motionless,  
erect  (slight  deviation  is allowable)  with knees  locked  the Chief  Referee  will give the signal  to begin  the lift. The 
signal  shall  consist  of a downward  movement  of the arm and the audible  command  “Squat”.  Before  receiving  the 
signal to “squat” the lifter may make any position adjustments within the rules, without penalty. For reasons of  
safety  the lifter  will be requested  to “Replace”  the bar, together  with a backward  movement  of the arm, if after 
a period  of five seconds  he is not  in the correct  position  to begin  the lift. The Chief  Referee  will then convey  the 
reason  why the signal  was not given.  
3. Upon  receiving  the Chief  Referee’s  signal  the lifter  must  bend  the knees  and lower  the body  until the top surface  
of the legs at the hip joint is lower  than the top of the knees.  Only  one decent  attempt  is allowed.  The attempt  
is deemed  to have  commenced  when  the lifters  knees  have  unlocked.  
4. The lifter must recover at will to an upright position with the knees locked. Double bouncing at the bottom of  
the squat attempt or any downward movement is not permitted. When the lifter is motionless (in the apparent  
final position)  the Chief  Referee  will give the signal  to rack the bar.  
5. The signal to  rack the bar will consist of  a backward motion of the arm and  the audible command “Rack”.  The 
lifter  must  then return  the bar to the racks.  Foot movement  after the rack signal  will not be cause  for failure.  For 
reasons of safety the lifter may request the aid of the spotter/loaders in returning the bar to, and replacing it  in 
the racks.  The lifter must  stay with the bar during  this process.   
6. Not more than five and not less than two spotter/loaders shall be on the platform at any time. The Referees may  
decide  to the number  of spotter/loaders  required  on the platform  at any time 2, 3, 4, or 5.Technical  Rules  book  of the International  Powerlifting  Federation

the lift easier.  
7. Contact  of the elbows  or upper  arms  with the legs. Slight  contact  is permitted  if there  is no supporting  that might  
aid the lifter.  
8. Any dropping  or dumping  of the bar after completion  of the lift. 
9. Failure  to comply  with any of the items  outlined  under  Rules  of Performance  for the squat.

The hair must not hide the back of the head when lying down on the bench. The Jury or Referees may require  
the lifter  to affix  his/her  hear accordingly.  
3. To achieve firm footing the lifter may use flat surfaced plates, or blocks not exceeding 30 cm in total height  
and a minimum dimension of 60 cm x 40 cm, to build up the surface of the platform. Blocks in the range of 5  
cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm, should  be made  available  for foot placement  at all international  competitions.  
4.  Not more than five and not less than two spotter/loaders shall be on the platform at any time. After correctly

motionless  and the bar properly  positioned.  For reasons  of safety  the lifter  will be requested  to “Replace”  the bar, 
together with a backward movement of the  arm, if  after a  period of five seconds he is not in the correct  
position  to begin  the lift. The Chief  Referee  will then convey  the reason  why the signal  was not given.  
7.  The signal to begin the attempt shall consist of a downward movement of the arm together with the audible  
command “Start”.  
8. After receiving the signal, the lifter must lower the bar to the chest or abdominal area whereby the underside  of 
both elbow joints  is lowered  level  with or below the top  surface of  each respective  shoulder joint  (the bar 
shall not touch  the belt),  hold it motionless,  after which  the Chief  referee  will signal  the audible  command  “Press 
“The lifter must then return the bar to straight arms’ length elbows locked. When held motionless in  this 
position  the audible  command  “Rack”  shall  be given together  with a backward  motion  of the arm. If the bar  is 
lowered  to the belt or  does not touch  the chest or  abdominal  area,  the Chief  Referee´s  command  is “Rack”.

2. Any change  in the elected  lifting  position  during  the lift proper  i.e. any raising  movement  of the head,  shoulders,  
or buttocks,  from  the bench,  or lateral  movement  of hands  on the bar.  
3. Heaving,  or sinking  the bar into the chest  or abdominal  area after it is motionless  in such a way as to make  the 
lift easier.  
4. Any downward  movement  of the whole  of the bar in the course  of being  pressed  out. 
5. Bar is not lowered  to chest  or abdominal  area i.e. not reaching  the chest  or abdominal  area,  or the bar is 
touching  the belt. 
6. Failure  to press  the bar to straight  arms’  length  elbows  locked  at the completion  of the lift. 
7. Contact  with the bar or the lifter  by the spotter/loaders  between  the Chief  Referee’s  signals,  in order  to make  
the lift easier.

Rules  for the Disabled  Competing  in IPF Single  Lift Bench  Press  
Championships  
Bench press championships shall be organized without a special division for disabled lifters e.g.  blind, sight  
impaired, mobility impaired. They may be assisted to, and from, the bench. Assisted to mean “with the help of  
the coach  or/and  with use of crutches,  sticks/canes  or wheelchair”.  The rules  of competition  apply  equally  to that 
of the able bodied.  For lifters  who have an amputated  lower  limb,  a prosthetic  device  shall be considered  the same  
as the natural  limb.  The lifter  shall be weighed in  without  the device,  with compensatory  weight  added  according  
to the established fraction chart. Refer to WEIGHING IN item 5. For lifters with dysfunctional lower limbs that  
require leg braces or similar devices for walking, the device shall be considered as part of the natural limb and  
the lifter  shall be weighed  in wearing  the device.Technical  Rules  book  of the International  Powerlifting  Federation  
January  2024  IPF Technical  Rules  Book  26  
  
Deadlift  
1. The lifter  shall face the front  of the platform  with the bar laid horizontally  in front  of the lifter’s  feet, gripped  
with an optional  grip in both hands  and lifted  until the lifter  is standing  erect.  
2. On completion  of the lift the knees  shall  be locked  in a straight  position  and the shoulders  back.  
3.  The Chief  Referee’s  signal  shall  consist  of a downward  movement  of the arm and the audible  command  
“Down”.  The signal  will not be given  until the bar is held motionless  and the lifter  is in the apparent  finished  
position.  
4. Any rising of  the bar  or any deliberate attempt to  do so will count as an  attempt. Once the attempt has  
begun no downward movement is allowed until the lifter reaches the erect position with the knees locked. If the  
bar settles  as the shoulders  come  back  (slightly  downward  on completion)  this should  not be reason  to disqualify  
the lift. 
 
 
Causes  for Disqualification  of a Deadlift  
1. Any downward  movement  of the bar before  it reaches  the final position.  
2. Failure  to stand  erect  with the shoulders  back.  
3. Failure  to lock the knees  straight  at the completion  of the lift. 
4. Supporting  the bar on the thighs  during  the performance  of the lift. If the bar edges  up the thigh  but is not supported  
this is not reason  for disqualification.  The lifter  should  benefit  in all decisions  of doubt  made  by the referee.  
5. Stepping  backward  or forward  or moving  the feet laterally.  Rocking  the feet between  the ball and heel is 
permitted.  Foot movement  after the command  “Down”  will not be cause  for failure.  
6. Lowering  the bar before  receiving  the Chief  Referee’s  signal.  
7. Allowing  the bar to return  to the platform  without  maintaining  control  with both hands,  i.e., releasing  the bar 
from  the palms  of the hand.  
8. Failure  to comply  with any of the items  outlined  under  Rules  of Performance  
 
 
The diagram  below  shows  a description  of supporting  the bar on the thighs:Technical  Rules  book  of the International  Powerlifting  Federation  
January  2024  IPF Technical  Rules  Book  27  
  
WEIGHING  IN 
 
1. Weighing in of the competitors must take place no earlier than two hours before the start of the competition for a  
particular category / category. All lifters in the category/categories must attend the weigh in, which will be carried out in  
the presence  of two / three  appointed  referees.  Weight  categories  may be combined  in a single  lifting  session.  
2. If not already done, lots will be drawn to  establish the order of weigh in. The lots drawn also establish the order of  
lifting  throughout  the competition  when  lifters  require  the same  weights  for their  attempts.  
3. The weigh  in period  will last one and a half hours.  
4. The weigh in for each competitor will be carried out in a room with the door closed, with only the competitor, his coach  
or manager of the same gender  and the two/three referees present. For reasons of hygiene the lifter should wear socks / 
paper towel on the  scale’s  platform.  Lifters  need to  identify  himself/herself with  an ID/Passport.  
5. Lifters  may be weighed  nude  or in underwear  which  complies with  the specifications  set out in the appropriate  section  
of the rule book  and which  does not effectively  change  the lifter’s weight.  If a question  exists  regarding  weight  of 
undergarments, a re -weigh in the nude may be requested. “In competitions in which both sexes are competitors, the  
weigh in procedure may be altered to ensure that lifters are weighed by officials of their own sex. Additional officials  
(not necessarily referees) may  be appointed  for this purpose”  
Disabled/Amputee lifters who are competing in  bench press championships will have the following additions to their  
bodyweight:  
For each below the ankle amputation  = 1/54 of bodyweight  
For each below the knee amputation  = 1/36 of bodyweight  
For each above the knee amputation   = 1/18 of bodyweight  
For each hip disarticulation  = 1/9 of bodyweight  
For lifters with dysfunctional lower limbs that require leg braces or similar devices for walking, the device shall be  
considered  as part of the natural  limb and the lifter  shall  be weighed  in wearing  the device.  
6. Each lifter may only be weighed once. Only those whose bodyweight is heavier or lighter than the category limits of the  
category entered are allowed to return to the scales. They must return to the scales and make weight within the limits of  
the hour and a half allowed  for the weigh  in; otherwise,  they will be eliminated  from  the competition.  A lifter  can only be 
re-weighed as often as time and orderly progression by lots allows. A lifter may only be weighed outside the time limit  
of one and a half hours if he presents himself within the time limit, but due to the number of lifters trying to make  
weight, he is denied the opportunity of mounting the scales. He may then be allowed one re -weigh at the discretion of  
the referees. The lifter’s agreed bodyweight must not be made public until all lifters competing in the particular  
category/categories  have  been  weighed  in. 
7. A lifter  may only weigh  in the category  in which  he was nominated  21 days prior  to the meet  date.  
In the case where groups are formed in a particular weight class the B and C groups may lift at a separate and earlier  
time to  the A group.  Where  groups  lift at separate  times  in this way the A group  must  have  a minimum  of 8 (eight)  and a 
maximum  of 14 (fourteen)  lifters.  
8. Lifters should check squat and bench press rack heights and foot blocks prior to the start of the competition. The rack  
height sheet must be signed or initialed after the check by the lifter or coach. It is in their interest. A copy of this offi cial 
document  goes to the Jury,  Speaker,  and Platform  Manager.  
 
 
ORDER  OF COMPETITION  
 
The  Round  System  
(a) At the weigh in, the lifter or his coach must declare a starting weight for all three lifts. These must be entered on the  
appropriate first attempt card, signed by the lifter or his coach and retained by the official conducting the weigh in.  
The speaker’s card is deemed to be the appropriate first attempt card. The lifter will then be given eleven blank  
attempt cards for use during the competition. Three for the squat, three for the bench press, and five for the deadlift.  
Each lift distinguished by using a different coloured card. Having made his first attempt at a lift, the lifter or his  
coach must decide upon the weight required for his second attempt. This weight must be filled in were indicated  
upon the card and submitted to the competition secretary or other appointed official before the one -minute time  
allowance  has elapsed.  The same  procedure  is to be used for the second  and third  attempts  on all three  lifts.Technical  Rules  book  of the International  Powerlifting  Federation  
January  2024  IPF Technical  Rules  Book  28  
 (b) Responsibility for submitting attempts within the time limit rests solely with the lifter or his coach. Under the round  
system, the need for numerous marshals is eliminated, the attempt card being handed directly to the designated  
official. Examples of attempt cards are illustrated. Remember that the box for first attempts on the cards in the  
lifter’s possession is only to be used for the permitted first attempt change if required. Similarly, the fourth and fifth  
boxes on  the deadlift card  are only to  be used for the two permitted changes on  the third  attempt deadlift if  
required.  In single  bench  press  competitions,  a card similar  to that  of the deadlift  will be used.

(b) Where  10 or more  lifters  are competing  in a session,  groups  may be formed  consisting  of approximately  equal  numbers  
of lifters.  However,  groups  must  be formed  when  15 or more  lifters  are competing  in the same  session.  A session  can 
be composed of a single bodyweight category or any combination of bodyweight categories at the discretion of the  
organizer for purpose of presentation. In single lift Bench Press Championships groups of up to twenty (20) may be  
formed.  
Grouping shall be determined by examining the lifters’ best totals achieved at national or international level during  
the previous  twelve  months.  The lifters  with the lowest  totals  will form  the first group  to lift with progressively  higher  
totals forming further groups as necessary. Where a lifter has not provided a total for the previous twelve months,  
then that lifter shall automatically  be placed  in the first group to  lift. 
(c) Each  lifter  will take his first attempt  in the first round,  his second  attempt  in the second  round  and his third  attempt  
in the third  round.  
(d) When a group consists of less than 6 lifters, compensatory time allowances shall be added at the end of each round  
as follows: For 5 lifters add 1 minute; 4 lifters add 2 minutes; 3 lifters add 3 minutes. 3 minutes is the maximum  
allowance permitted at the end of a round. Should a lifter follow himself when the compensatory clock is in  
operation, 3 minutes is the maximum allowance permitted. For compensatory time where groups are involved,  
unloading  of the bar will take place  at the end of the compensatory  time,  reloaded,  then the one minute  to begin  the 
attempt.  
(e) The bar must  be loaded  progressively  during  each round  on the principle  of a rising  bar. At no time will the weight  
on the bar be lowered  within  a round  except  for errors  as described  in item (i), and then only at the end of a round.  
(f) Lifting order within each round will be determined by the lifter’s choice of weight for that round. In the event of  
two lifters  choosing  the same  weight,  the lifter  with the lowest  lot number  drawn  at the weigh  in, will  lift first. The 
same applies to third round deadlift attempts, whereby the weight may be changed twice, subject to the bar not  
having  already  been  loaded  to the lifters  originally  chosen  weight  and the lifter  having  been  called  to the bar by the 
speaker.  
Example:  Lifter  A with lot number  5 puts in 250.0  kg. 
Lifter  B with lot number  2 puts in 252.5  kg. 
Lifter  A fails with 250.0  kg. Can Lifter  B drop the weight  to 250.0  kg to win?  
No, the order  of lifting  is still determined  by the lot number.  
(g) If unsuccessful  with an attempt,  the lifter  does not follow  himself,  but must  wait until the next round  before  he can 
attempt  that weight  again.  
(h) If in a round an attempt is unsuccessful due to a wrongly loaded bar, spotter error, equipment failure or any other  
fault and through no fault of his own, the lifter will be granted a further attempt at the correct weight. The lifter  
shall take his extra attempt at the end of the round except if the lift is a record attempt, the lifter shall always  
follow himself no matter what round it is. If the lifter also happens to be the last lifter in the round, he shall be  
granted a three -minute rest prior to making his attempt, last but one in the round two minutes, last but two in the  
round one minute. In these cases where lifters are following themselves and given compensatory rest time the bar  
will be loaded as soon as the new attempt is turned in. The compensatory time will then be added to the usual one  
minute to begin the attempt. The clock will be started and the lifter will have that time to begin his attempt. Lifters  
following themselves will have four minutes time placed on the clock, during which time the lifter can begin his  
attempt  as soon  as he is ready.  Lifters  last but one in the round  will be given  three  minutes,  last but two in the round  
will be given two minutes, all others will be given the usual one minute to begin the attempt. In the third round of  
deadlifting and single bench press, if a lifter of any reason gets a new extra attempt by the jury, (wrongly loaded  
bar, spotter error or equipment failure) the lifter will be granted a further attempt at the correct weight, the lifter  
must  be following  him/herself.  
(i)  A lifter is permitted one change of weight on the first attempt of each lift. The change of weight may be higher or  
lower than that originally submitted and the order of lifting in the first round will change accordingly. If he is in the  
first group, this change may take place at any time up to within three minutes before the start of the first round of  
that lift. The following groups are accorded a similar privilege up to within three attempts from the end of the  
previous group’s last round of that lift. Prior notice of these deadlines shall be announced by the speaker. If proper  
notice of these deadlines is not given, then an announcement authorizing such changes shall be made and a lifter  
may make  a change  within  one minute  of such announcement.  
(j) A lifter must submit his second and third attempts within one minute of completing his preceding attempt. The one  
minute will begin from the time that the lights are activated. If no weight is submitted within the one -minute time  
allowance, the lifter will be granted a 2.5 kg increase on his next attempt. Should the lifter have failed his previous  
attempt and not submitted a weight for a further attempt within the one -minute time allowance, then the bar will be  
loaded  to the failed  weight.Technical  Rules  book  of the International  Powerlifting  Federation  
January  2024  IPF Technical  Rules  Book  30  
  
(k) Weights  submitted  for second  round  attempts  on all three  lifts cannot  be changed.  Similarly,  third  round  attempts  on 
the squat and bench press cannot be changed. Under this rule once an attempt is turned in, it cannot be withdrawn.  
The bar shall  be loaded  to the turned  in weight  and the clock  will be run. 
(l) In the third  round  of the deadlift,  two changes  are permitted.  The change  of the weight  may be higher  or lower  than 
the lifters previously submitted third attempt. However, these are only permitted provided that the lifter has not  
been  called  to the bar already  loaded  to his previously  submitted  weight  by the speaker.  
(m) In bench  press  single  lift competition  rules  in general  are the same  as for three  lift competitions.  However,  in the 
third round, two weight changes are permitted and the rules as stated in (m) above for the deadlift apply equally  
here.  
(n) If a lifting session consists of a single group, i.e., up to a maximum of 14 lifters, an interval of 20 minutes shall be  
allowed  between  the lifts. This is to ensure  adequate  time for warm  up and  platform  organization.  
(o) When  two or more  groups  take part in a session  upon  a single  platform,  lifting  will be organized  on a group  repetition  
basis. After the end of each discipline consisting of more than one group (squat, bench press) a time interval of 10  
minutes  is to be given  between  the disciplines.  
 
For example, if there are two groups taking part in a session, the first group will complete all three rounds of the  
squat. They will be followed immediately by the second group who will complete their three rounds of squat. The  
platform will then be set up for the bench press and the first group will complete their three rounds of the bench  
press, immediately followed by the second group who will similarly complete their three rounds of the bench press.  
The platform will then be set up for the deadlift and the first group will complete their three rounds of the deadlift,  
immediately followed by the second group who will similarly complete their three rounds of the deadlift. This  
system  thus eliminates  any time waste  other  than that necessary  for arranging  the platform  between  the lifts. 
The Technical  Committee  with the co-operation  and assistance  of the organizer  will appoint  the following  officials:  
(a) Speaker/Announcer,  a national  or International  Referee  who is able to converse  in English  and that of the host 
nation.  
(b) Technical  Secretary,  an International  Referee  preferably  able to converse  and write  in English  and that of the host 
nation.  
(c) Time  Keeper  (a qualified  referee).  
(d) Marshals/Expeditors.  
(e) Scorers.  
(f) Spotter/Loaders.  Correct  code  of dress  - Meet  t-shirt or regular  t-shirt uniform  in color.  Track  suit trousers  
uniform  in color.  Trainers  or sports  shoes.  Athletic  shorts  may be worn  in hot weather  on the ruling  of the jury. 
(g) Technical  Controller  (a qualified  international  referee).  
(h) Additional  officials  may be appointed  as required,  e.g. doctors,  paramedics  etc. 
Responsibilities  of the Officials  
(a) The speaker  is responsible  for the efficient  running  of the competition.  He acts as Master  of Ceremonies  and arranges  
the attempts chosen by the lifters in an orderly fashion, dictated by weight and, if necessary, lot number. He  
announces  the weight  required  for the next attempt  and the  name  of the lifter.  When  the bar is loaded  and the platform  
cleared for  lifting, the  Chief Referee  will indicate the fact  to the Speaker. When the Speaker announces that the  
bar is ready  and calls the lifter  to the platform,  the clock  will begin.  
To clarify, - when the Speaker announces that the bar is “ready/loaded”, then the lifter is committed to the attempt.  
Attempts  announced  by the speaker  must  be displayed  upon  the scoreboard  erected  in a prominent  position,  with 
the lifter’s  names  in order  of lot number.  
 
(b) ) The Technical  Secretary  is responsible  for attending  the technical  meeting  prior  to the competition.  In the 
absence of  the Technical Committee or  a member of  that committee the  Technical Secretary will compile the  
Jury and Referee schedules from the names of those referees declared available for duty throughout the  
competition. He  will complete  the necessary  “Duty  Referees  and Jury Members”  lists for the competition  
and inform  referees  of categories to  which  they have been  allocated. After  the technical meeting when  final 
team nominations have been compiled, the technical secretary will initiate a score sheet, non -itemized equipment  
check sheet, rack height sheet and order of weigh in sheet for each category in the competition, entering the names  
of all lifters nominated in that category. Lots may also be drawn at this stage to establish weigh in and lifting order.  
He will also make out  speaker  competition  cards  for every  lifter  in the  category.  
The above  paper  work  together  with an adequate  supply  of lifter’s  attempt  slips/cards  will be placed  in the appropriate  
envelope for each bodyweight category in the competition and handed to the Chief Referee for that category. The  
technical  secretary  will attend  each weigh  in and advise  the dutyTechnical  Rules  book  of the International  Powerlifting  Federation  
January  2024  IPF Technical  Rules  Book  31  
  
(c)  referees upon procedure and any matters that require attention. He should be an international referee preferably  
from the host nation and able to deal with any problem that may arise due to language difficulties at the venue. It is  
the responsibility of the meet director to provide all necessary blank forms and paperwork to enable the technical  
secretary to carry out his work. A complete dossier on the job description together with all relative paperwork can  
be obtained  from  the Technical  Committee  free of charge  available  to all Meet  Directors.  
 
(d) The time keeper is responsible for accurately recording the lapse between the announcement that the bar is ready  
and the lifter starting his attempt. He is also responsible for recording time allowances whenever required, e.g.  after 
an attempt the lifter shall leave the platform within 30 seconds. Once the clock is running for a lifter, it can only be  
stopped by the completion of a time allowance, by the start of the lift, or at the discretion of the Chief Referee.  
Consequently, it is of great importance that the lifter or his coach check the height of the squat racks prior to being  
called, as once the bar is announced as being ready, the clock will be started. Any further adjustments to the racks  
must be made within the lifter’s one -minute allowance, unless the lifter has nominated his rack height and this has  
been incorrectly set by the  spotter/loaders. It is therefore essential that the rack height sheet be  signed or initialed  
by the lifter or coach. This is an official document, which should verify in any dispute. The lifter is allowed one  
minute in which to start his attempt after the Speaker calls the lifter to the bar. If he does not start his attempt within  
this time allowance, the time keeper will call time and the Chief Referee shall give the audible command “rack”  
together with a backward movement of the arm. The lift will be declared “no lift” and the attempt forfeited. When  
the lifter starts the lift within the prescribed time allowance, the clock will be stopped. The definition of the start of  
an attempt depends upon the particular lift being performed. In the squat and bench press, the start is to coincide  
with the Chief Referee’s commencement signal. Refer to “Referees” item 3. In the deadlift, the start is when the  
lifter  makes  a determined  attempt  to raise  the bar.  
 
(e) Marshals/Expeditors are responsible for collecting the weight of required attempts from the lifters or their coaches  
and passing the information without delay to the speaker. The lifter is allowed one minute between completing his  
last attempt  and informing  the speaker,  via the marshal,  of the weight  required  for his next attempt.  
 
(f) Scorers are responsible for accurately recording the progress of the competition, and on completion, ensuring that  
the three referees sign the official score sheets, record certificates or any other document requiring signatures.  
Speaker  to make  an announcement  to this effect  before  the referees  disappear.  
 
(g) Spotter/loaders are responsible for loading and unloading the bar, adjusting squat racks and benches as required,  
cleaning the bar or platform at the request of the Chief Referee, and generally ensuring that the platform is well  
maintained  and presents  a neat and tidy appearance  at all times.  At no time shall  there  be less than two or more  than 
five spotter/loaders  on the platform.  
When the  lifter prepares for his attempt, the  spotter/loaders may assist him in removing the bar from the racks.  
They may also assist in replacing the bar after the attempt. However, they shall not touch the lifter or the bar during  
the actual attempt, i.e., during the period of time that elapses between the commencement and completion signals.  
The only exception to this rule being that if the lift is in jeopardy and likely to result in injury to the lifter, the  
spotter/loaders  may,  either  at the request  of the Chief  Referee  or the lifter  himself,  step in and relieve  the lifter  of 
the bar. If the lifter  himself  is deprived  of an otherwise  successful  attempt  by the error  of a spotter/loader  and through  
no fault of his own, he shall be awarded another attempt at the discretion of the Referees and Jury at the end of the  
round.  
 
(h) The Technical  Controller  will ensure  that the lifter  is that as announced  and properly  attired  before  mounting  the 
platform.  He/she  must  also attend  the equipment  control.

During any competition taking place on a platform or stage, only the lifter and ONE (1) coach , members of the Jury,  
officiating referees, spotter/loaders and the Technical Controller will be allowed around the platform or on the stage.  
During the execution of  the lift, only  the lifter, spotter/loaders and the referees are permitted  to be present on  the 
platform.  Coaches  shall remain  within  the designated  coaching  area as defined by  the Jury or Technical Officer  in 
charge. The coaching area must be made in such a way that allows the coach to place himself with a good view to the  
lifter  with the possibility  to give instructions  and signals  to the lifter  regarding  technical  details  (e.g. depth  in squat).  
The coach area should be on a  distance of no  longer than 5  meters from the stage and it should be longer than the  
lifting  stage  that permits  a walking  area for the  coach  to see  the lift from  any side back  or side front  angle.  
 
Dress code for coaches at international events shall be national team tracksuit plus team or IPF approved t -shirt, or sport  
shorts plus team or  IPF approved t -shirt, NO HATS, NOT TAKING PICTURES or MAKING VIDEOS . Coach  
must adhere to this code failing which on the ruling of the Technical Controller or Jury it may result in the coach being  
excluded  from  the event  warm up  room  and competition  surrounds.  SEE COACH  RESPONSIBLE  DOCUMENT  on 
Page 45. 
 
 
2. A lifter shall not wrap, adjust his costume or use ammonia within view of the public. The only exception to this rule  
being  that he may  adjust  his belt. 
 
3. In international matches between two lifters or two nations contested in different bodyweight categories, the lifters may  
alternate  irrespective  of weight  required  for the attempts.  The lifter  requiring  the lightest  weight  in his initial  lift shall  lift 
first and thereby  set the order  for the alternate  attempts  throughout  that particular  lift. 
 
4. In IPF recognized competitions, the weight of the barbell must always be a multiple of 2.5 kg. Unless attempts are made  
on records, in Squat,  Bench  Press  and Deadlift, the  progression  must  be at least 2.5 kg between  all attempts.  
(a) In a record attempt  the weight  of the barbell  must  be at least 0.5 kg in  excess  of the current  record.  
(b) During the course of competition, a lifter may request a record attempt that is not a multiple of 2.5 kg. If the attempt  
is successful,  it will  be added  to both  the individual  lift and  total.  
(c) Record  attempts  may be taken  on any or all of the lifter’s  prescribed  attempts.  
(d) A lifter may only take increments of less than 2.5 kg for record attempts in the championship in which he is  
competing,  e.g. a Master  lifting  in an open  competition  cannot  take less than 2.5 kg to achieve  Master’s  records.  
(e) In the event of a weight posted for the following round, which is not a multiple of 2.5 kg to exceed a record, the  
weight  will be reduced  to the nearest  multiple  of 2.5 kg, should  a fellow  competitor  have  exceeded  this weight  in the 
previous  round.  
 
Example  1: The current  record  is 302.5  kg. 
Lifter  A squats  300 kg in the first round  then posts  303.5  kg, Lifter  B squats  305 kg in the first round.  
Lifter  A second  attempt  now is reduced  to 302.5  kg. 
 
Example  2: The current  record  is 300 kg. 
Lifter  A posts  only a 1 kg increment  (301 kg) having  achieved  his first attempt  of 300 kg in the above  scenario,  Lifter  B squats  
305 kg in the first round,  Lifter  A must  now take the nearest  2.5 kg above  (302.5  kg).Technical  Rules  book  of the International  Powerlifting  Federation  
January  2024  IPF Technical  Rules  Book  33  
 5. The Chief  Referee  will be solely  responsible  for decisions  taken  in the case of loading  errors  or incorrect  announcements  
by the speaker. His decisions will be given to the speaker who will make the appropriate announcement. Examples of  
errors  in loading:  
 
(a) If the bar is loaded to a lighter weight than originally requested and the attempt is successful, he lifter may accept  
the successful attempt or elect to take the attempt again at the originally requested weight. If the attempt is not  
successful, the lifter will be granted a further attempt at the originally requested weight. In both the above cases,  
further  attempts  may only be taken  at the end of the round  in which  the error  occurred.  
(b) If the bar is loaded to a heavier weight than originally requested and the attempt is successful, the lifter will be  
granted the attempt. However, the weight may be reduced again if required for other lifters. If the attempt is not  
successful,  the lifter  will be granted  a further  attempt  at the end of the round  in which  the error  occurred.  
(c) If the loading is  not the same  on each end of the bar; or any change  occurs  to the bar or discs  during  the execution  
of the lift; or the platform is disarranged, if despite these factors, the lift is successful, the lifter may accept the  
attempt or  elect to  take the attempt again. If the successful attempt is not a multiple of 2.5 kg, then the lower  
closest,  multiple  of 2.5 kg will be recorded  on the score  sheet.  If the attempt  is unsuccessful,  the lifter  will be granted  
a further  attempt.  Further  attempts  may only be taken  at the end of the round  in which  the error  occurred.  
(d) If the  speaker  makes  a mistake  by announcing  a weight  lighter  or heavier  than that requested  by the lifter.  The Chief  
Referee  will make  the same  decisions  as for errors  in loading.  
(e) If for any reason it is not possible for the lifter or his coach to remain in the vicinity of the platform in order to  
follow the  progress of the competition and  the lifter  misses his attempt because the speaker omitted to  announce  
him at the appropriate weight, then the weight will be reduced as necessary and the lifter allowed to take his  
attempt,  but only at the end  of the round.  
(f) If the lifter himself is deprived of an otherwise successful attempt by the error of a spotter/loader, wrongly loaded bar  
or any other fault and through no fault of his own, he shall be awarded another attempt at the discretion of the Referees  
and Jury at the end of the round. If any lift is a record attempt the lifter shall always follow himself no matter what  
round it  is. 
 
6. Three unsuccessful attempts in any lift will automatically eliminate the lifter from the overall competition. He may still  
compete for awards on individual lifts if he makes bona fide attempts on each of the lifts i.e., weights attempted must be  
within his  reasonable  capabilities.  If this is questionable the  Jury will decide.  
 
7. Other than initial removal of the bar from the racks, the lifter will not receive any help from the spotter / loaders in  
positioning himself  for an attempt.  
 
8. On the completion of an attempt, a lifter shall leave the platform within 30 seconds; failure to comply with this rule may  
result in disqualification of the attempt at the discretion of the referees. This rule was designed for lifters who may have  
received some  injury  during the course  of the lift, or perhaps  the less able bodied, e.g.  the blind  lifter.  
 
9. If, during warm up or competition, a lifter suffers injury or in any other way exhibits signs of a condition which  
may unduly or significantly jeopardize the competitor’s health and wellbeing, the official doctor has the right to  
examination. If the doctor considers it inadvisable for the lifter to continue, he may, in consultation with the  
Jury, insist upon the lifter retiring from the competition. The team manager or coach must be officially informed  
of such a decision. To avoid contamination a solution of one -part household bleach to 10 parts water is  
recommended to clean blood or tissue from the bar or platform and that in the warmup area should “accidents”  
occur.  
 
10. Any lifter  or coach,  who by reason  of his misconduct  upon  or near the competition  platform  is likely  to discredit  the sport,  
shall be officially warned. If the misconduct continues, the Jury, or Referees in the absence of the Jury, may disqualify  
the lifter or coach and order the lifter or coach to leave the venue. The team manager must be officially informed of both  
warning and  disqualification.  
 
11. The Jury and Referees  may by a majority  decision  immediately  disqualify  a lifter  or official  if they are of the opinion  that 
any misconduct  is serious  enough  to warrant  immediate  disqualification  rather  than an official  warning.  The team  manager  
must  be informed  of the disqualification.Technical  Rules  book  of the International  Powerlifting  Federation  
January  2024  IPF Technical  Rules  Book  34  
  
12.  In international competition, all appeals against referee’s decisions, complaints regarding the progress of the  
competition or against the behavior of any person or persons taking part in the competition must be made to the Jury.  
The Jury may require the appeal to be made in writing. The appeal or complaint must be lodged with the Chairman of  
the Jury by the team manager, coach or in his absence, by the lifter. This must be done immediately following the action  
upon  which  the appeal  or complaint  is based.  It will  not be considered  unless  these  terms  are met. 
 
13. If deemed necessary, the Jury may temporarily suspend the progress of the competition and retire to consider its verdict.  
After  due consideration  and upon  reaching  a unanimous  verdict,  the Jury will return  and the Chairman  will inform  the 
complainant  of its decision.  The Jury’s  verdict  will be considered  final and there  will be no right  of appeal  to any other  
body.  Upon  recommencement  of the competition  which  has been  suspended,  the next lifter  shall be given  three  minutes  
in which  to commence  his lift. In the event  of a complaint  being  made  against  a lifting  member  or official  of an 
opposing  team,  “The jury will not consider challenges relating to the referees’ decision on lifts performed by 
an athlete from an opposing team ” the written  complaint shall  be accompanied by  the cash sum of  Euro  75 or its 
equivalent in  any currency.  Should  the Jury in its verdict  consider  that the complaint  is of a frivolous  or 
mischievous  nature,  then the whole  or any  portion  of the sum may be retained  and donated  to the IPF  at the discretion  of 
the Jury.Technical  Rules  book  of the International  Powerlifting  Federation  
January  2024  IPF Technical  Rules  Book  35  
  
REFEREES  
 
1. The referees  shall  be three  in number,  the Chief  Referee  or Center  Referee  and two side referees.  Their  international  
referee  cards  should  be in  date,  and that of the Technical  Controller,  and placed  on the Jury table.  
2. The Chief  Referee  is responsible  for giving  the necessary  signals  for all three  lifts. 
3. Signals  required  for the three  lifts are as follows:  
 
 
Lift Commencement  Completion  
Squat  A visual  signal  consisting  of 
a downward movement of  
the arm together  with the 
audible  command  “squat”  A visual  signal  consisting of  
a backward movement of the  
arm together with  the audible  
command  “rack”  
Bench  Press  A visual  signal  consisting  of 
a downward movement of  
the arm together with the  
audible  command  “start”.  
 
During:  
The audible command  
“Press”  after motionless  at 
the chest and the visible  
signal  of an upward  
movement  of the arm. A visual  signal  consisting  of 
a backward movement of the  
arm together with the audible  
command  “rack”  
Deadlift  No signal  required  A visual  signal  consisting  of 
a downward movement of 
the arm together with the  
audible  command  “down”  
When  a lifter  fails to complete  a squat  or a bench  press,  the command  is “rack”.  
 
 
4. Once the bar has been replaced in the racks or on the platform at the completion of the lift, the referees will announce  
their decisions by means of the lights. White for a “good lift” and red for “no lift”. The cards will then be raised to  
indicate  the reason  for the “no lift”. 
5. The three referees may seat themselves in what they consider to be the best viewing positions around the platform in a  
range not farther than 4 meters for each of the three lifts. However, the Chief Referee must always bear in mind the need  
to be visible  to the lifter  performing  the squat  or deadlift,  and the side referees  should  always  bear in mind  the need  to 
be visible  to the Chief  Referee  so that he can  observe  their raised  arms  
6. Before  the contest,  the three  referees  shall  jointly  ascertain  that: 
(a) The platform and competition equipment comply in all respects with the rules. Bars and discs are checked for  
weight discrepancies and defective equipment discarded. A second bar and collars should be readied and put aside  
in case of damage  to the original  bar or collars.  
(b) The scales  work  correctly  and are accurate  (currently  certified).  
(c) The lifters  weigh  in within  the limits  of weight  and time for their bodyweight  category.  
(d) The lifter’s personal equipment has been inspected to comply with the rules in all respects. It is the duty of the lifter  
to ensure that all items he wishes to wear on the platform have passed the scrutiny of the examining referees. Lifters  
discovered wearing or using apparel that has not been checked in may be subject to penalty, e.g.  disqualification of  
the last attempt.  
 
7. During  the contest  the three  referees  must  jointly  ascertain  that: 
 
(a) The weight of the loaded  bar agrees with the weight announced by the speaker. Referees may be issued with  
loading  charts  for this purpose.  It is their joint responsibility.Technical  Rules  book  of the International  Powerlifting  Federation  
January  2024  IPF Technical  Rules  Book  36  
 (b) On the platform the lifter’s personal equipment complies with the rules. If any referee has reason to doubt a lifter’s  
integrity  in this respect  he must  after completion  of the lift, inform  the Chief  
Referee of his suspicions. The president of the Jury may then examine the lifter’s personal equipment. If the lifter is  
found to be wearing or using any illegal item other than that which may have inadvertently been passed in error by  
the examining  referees,  the lifter shall  be immediately  disqualified  from  the competition.  If wearing  any illegal  item 
passed  in error  by the examining  referees,  and the lift in which  the discovery  was made  is successful,  the lift will be 
rejected and then the lifter will be granted a new attempt (having removed the illegal item) at the end of the round.  
Should a Technical Controller be in evidence, the lifter's attire will be scrutinized before he/she is allowed onto the  
platform.  
 
8. Prior to the commencement of the Squat and Bench press the side referees will raise their arms and keep them raised  
until the lifter is in the correct position to begin the lift. If there is a majority opinion among the referees that a fault  
exists, the Chief Referee will not give the signal to commence the lift. The lifter has the remainder of his unexpired time  
allowance in which to correct the position of the bar or his stance in order to receive the commencement signal. Once a  
lift has commenced,  the side referees  will not call attention  to faults  during  the execution  of the lift. 
9. Referees shall abstain from commentary and not receive any document or verbal account concerning the progress of the  
competition. Therefore, it is essential that the lot number of each lifter accompanies his name on the scoreboard so that  
the referees  can follow  the order  of lifting.  
10. A referee  shall  not attempt  to influence  the decisions  of the other  referees.  
11. The Chief Referee may consult with the side referees, the Jury or any other official as necessary in order to expedite the  
competition.  
12. At his discretion, the Chief Referee may order that the bar and/or platform be cleaned. If the lifter or coach request the  
bar and / or platform to be cleaned, the request must be made via the Chief Referee/Technical Controller not the  
spotter/loaders.  In the final round  of the deadlift  the bar must  be cleaned  before  every  attempt,  and in any of the other  two 
rounds,  should  the coach  or lifter  desire.  
13. After the competition, the three referees shall sign the official score sheets, record certificates or any other documents  
requiring  a signature.  
14. In International  Competition,  referees  will be selected  by the Technical  Committee  and must  have proved  their 
competence  at International  or National  Championships.  
15. In International  Competition s two referees  of the same  nation  can be selected  to adjudicate  in a contest  where  more  than 
one nation  competes,  and the nation  the referees  represent  has no lifters  nominated for the  Championship . 
If a category consists of more than one group, all groups should have the same referees. If a change of referees is  
necessary the change should be made between the disciplines, so that all lifters have the same referees in the same  
discipline.  
16. The selection of a referee to act as Chief Referee in one category does not preclude his selection as side referee in  
another  category.  
17. At World  Championships, or  any other  championships where attempts may be  made on world records, only IPF  
category 1 or category 2 referees adjudicate. Each nation may nominate a maximum of three referees to serve at the  
World Championships, plus extra category 1 referees for Jury duty, if there is an insufficient number. All nominated  
referees  attending  a championship,  must  be available  for at least two days.  
18. Referees  and members  of the Jury will be uniformly  dressed  as follows:  
Men,  winter:  Dark  blue blazer  with appropriate  IPF badge  on the left breast.  
Proper grey trousers  (not jeans)  with a white  shirt and appropriate  IPF tie. 
Men,  summer:  Proper  grey trousers  (not jeans)  with a white  shirt and appropriate  IPF tie. 
Women, winter:  Dark  blue blazer  with appropriate  IPF badge  on the left breast.  
Proper  grey skirt or trousers  (not jeans)  and a white  blouse  or shirt,  and 
appropriate  scarf/tie.  
Women,  summer:    Proper  grey skirt or trousers  (no jeans)  and a white  blouse  or shirt.  
 
IPF badges and scarf/ties are red for category 1 referees and blue for category 2 referees. The Jury shall determine  
whether winter or summer dress will be worn. Shoes known as “trainers” do not compliment blazer and trousers!
